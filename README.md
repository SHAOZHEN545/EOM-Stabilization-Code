# EOM-Stabilization-Code

Arduino codes for 1833 EOM and 1903 EOM share almost the same setup codes, except for nuances in temperature setpoints and PID parameters, and loop sequences.

Communication between the Linduino board and the TEC controller board is via the **output_voltage_dev** function.
